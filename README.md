# 3.Multi-class-Classification-and-Neural-Networks-

1. Uses one-vs-all method to achieve multi-class classification for recognizing hand-written numebers.
   The core algorithm is logistic regression.

2. With a pre-trained neural network, use forward propagation to train parameters for recognizing hand-written
   numbers.
